  "Changelog":
"1.3.0.0: 6.1 changes.
				 All Kaiten-based features are removed, for what should be obvious reasons.
				 Jump to Mirage Dive removed (now implemented in-game).
				 Searing Light removed from Carby Feature.
				 Wanderer's to Pitch Perfect removed (now implemented in-game).
				 Dancer Flourish Proc Saver removed, as now the procs Flourish provides are separate from your normal combo procs.
				 Warrior combos to Fell Cleave removed due to changes to Inner Release. AoE functionality still the same.
				 Overpower combo no longer defaults to Mythril Tempest if you have no target.
				 Storm's Path to Storm's Eye added. Only functions if the buff isn't up, so you will still need to keep Storm's Eye on your bar for upkeep.

If a recent change isn't documented on this changelog, it is because it doesn't affect plugin functionality, or is a minor bugfix.",
